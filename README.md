# Email Scheduler Function Documentation

Documentation was written by ChatGPT

## Overview
This code is an implementation of an email scheduler function in C#, built using Microsoft Azure Function. The purpose of this function is to read email data from an Azure Table storage and send emails to the recipients based on a specific schedule.

## Dependencies
The code uses the following external libraries and components:
```
System
System.Net
System.Net.Mail
System.Threading.Tasks
Microsoft.Azure.WebJobs
Microsoft.Extensions.Logging
Microsoft.Azure.WebJobs.Extensions.Tables
Azure.Data.Tables
Azure
Microsoft.Extensions.Configuration
System.Runtime.CompilerServices
```

## Functionality

The main functionality of the code is implemented in the Run method. It is a timer trigger function that is executed at a specific schedule as defined by the TimerTrigger attribute, which is set to run daily at midnight (0 0 0 * * *).

The function reads email data from an Azure Table storage and sends emails to the recipients. The email data contains the recipient email address, subject, and body of the email.

Before sending emails, the function reads the sender's email address and password from the app settings, using the Configuration object and GetValue method. The SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol) client is set up using the SmtpClient class, and the sender's email and password are used to set the credentials.

The function uses a foreach loop to iterate over the data entities stored in the Azure Table storage. For each entity, the function creates a new MailMessage object, sets the recipient, subject, and body of the email, and sends the email using the SmtpClient object.

The code also includes a DataEntity class, which implements the ITableEntity interface. This class represents a single data entity in the Azure Table storage and contains properties for the subject, recipient, body, send date, partition key, row key, timestamp, and ETag.

## Logging
The code uses the ILogger object passed as an argument to the function to log information about the function's execution, such as when the function is triggered and when an email is sent successfully. The LogInformation method is used to log information messages.

## Configuration
The sender's email address and password are stored as user secrets, which are stored securely and can be retrieved at runtime using the IConfiguration object and GetValue method. The ConfigurationBuilder class is used to build the configuration object.

## Conclusion
This code provides a basic implementation of an email scheduler function in C#, built using Microsoft Azure WebJobs and Azure Table storage. The function is triggered at a specific schedule and reads email data from an Azure Table storage to send emails to the recipients. The code also includes logging and configuration capabilities.
